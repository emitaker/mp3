# MP3 player 
## Description 
 The problem that was initially proposed was to design a mp3 player using a microcontroller or a microprocessor of our choice. We decided that are going to develop a prototype composed by a microcontroller(Arduino Mega) and a microcomputer(RaspberryPi). To communicate along the two devices we'll be using Python, just to simplify future problems. 
In this repository is all the source code and all the dependencies of the project.

## Python libraries
* To play the music we use `Vlc`
* To manage the intervals of time better `time`
* To use the GPIO ports `RPi.GPIO`
* `random`
* To get the info of the songs `MediaInfo`
